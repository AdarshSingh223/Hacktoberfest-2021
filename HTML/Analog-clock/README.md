I have build a real-time analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Prerequisite:
Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Approach: We will create three files (HTML file, a CSS file, and JavaScript File), we also have an image of the clock that will be used in the background, and on top of that, we will make an hour, minute, and second hand (using HTML and CSS). These hands will rotate as per the system time (we will use the predefined Date function of JavaScript to calculate the degree of rotations of each hand).

HTML: It is a simple file having the basic structure of the webpage and ID for the clockâ€™s body and for the second, minute, hour hands.
CSS: The CSS is used just for making the clock actually look a bit nicer. We have basically centered our clock in the middle of the webpage.
JavaScript: The JavaScript file will provide the logic behind the rotation of the hands.
